# SomeonePlaysPokemon

This is a clone of the famous [twitchplayspokemon](http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) application. This implementation uses a combination of python, javascript, nodejs and additional tools like xwininfo or xdotool.

## Goal
It's my aim to avoid the lag which is introduced by twitch using an efficient javascript/nodejs interaction.
